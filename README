This is my Python examples repo.  Feel free to grab stuff, but you probably shouldn't expect anything groundbreaking here.

===== TEMPERATURE =====
./temperature contains a Raspberry Pi home-based project using a DS18B20 digital temperature sensor.
The original code from learn.adafruit.com is in adafruit-readtemp.py
My code is based on that tutorial in therm.py and what I've changed is described in the comments.

The purpose for my project is simply to allow the Raspberry Pi to collect temperature readings over a given
amount of time and store the readings in a file for later analysis.
